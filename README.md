Financial Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to perform sentiment analysis on financial datasets. Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding public opinion and market sentiment, especially in the financial domain. RNN and LSTM models have proven to be effective in capturing sequential patterns and contextual information, making them suitable for analyzing text data. This project aims to explore the use of RNN and LSTM models for sentiment analysis on financial data and evaluate their performance in predicting sentiment.
